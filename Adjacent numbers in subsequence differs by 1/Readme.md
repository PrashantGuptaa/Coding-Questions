Given an array of N integers, your task is to find the longest subsequence such that the difference between adjacent numbers in the subsequence is equal to 1
Input
First line of input contains a single integer N. Next line of input contains N space- separated integers depicting the elements of the array.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Arr[i] <= 10000
Output
Print the length of the longest subsequence.

Sample Input:-
5
4 6 1 5 4

Sample Output:-
3

Explanation:-
there are two subsequences of size 3 that fit this criterion:- 4 5 4 and 6 5 4

Sample input:-
8
1 2 3 2 3 7 2 1

Sample Output:-
7
