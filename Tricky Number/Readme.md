We define a number A as a good integer if:
the number of divisors (excluding 1 and the number itself) of A is greater than 0 and the divisors would be in consecutive sequence when arranged in sorted order
Given a number N, calculate the number of good integers less than or equal to N.
Input
The input contains a single integer N.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 109
Output
Print the number of good integers less than or equal to N.
